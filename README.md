# SpareGrub - Reducing Food Wastage

## The concept

As part of my software development bootcamp, I had to come up with an idea for my final project to demonstrate my understanding of React. [SpareGrub](https://sparegrub.co.uk) was created as my answer to reducing food wastage.

This is the frontend repo, for the backend repo click [here](https://github.com/lexybeney/sparegrub-backend).

## What I used

- React ([Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app))
- [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) for API calls
- [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/) and [Bootstrap](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap) for styling
- [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) for state management
- [Joi](https://github.com/hapijs/joi) for validation
- [Bing Maps](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/bingmaps/rest-services/locations/find-a-location-by-address) for forward geocoding
- [GSAP](https://github.com/greensock/GSAP) for animation
